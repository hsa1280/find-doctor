Assumptions I made for this project:
1. For list of similar doctors, I use list of doctors in the specified practice. 
2. I am using betterDoctor api for this project

A few thoughts to improve:
1. make it look better, responsive
2. add more search abilities to the app, like search by zipcode, city, gender etc.
3. add some unit tests for the app
4. add continuous integration pipeline
5. add load-spinner to load data
